I forgot about what we came, after a while, and got, cought up in the story, which I’ve always thought is a classic movie, anyway; this would be my third time seening Sundance. The time in the theater spiraled and stretched the way it does in a good film, and I watched awhile for technical reason… how each scene now and not later on. I tried to look at it that way, but got spun up in the story and forgot. 
About the part where Butch and Sundance are surrounded by the entire Bolivian army, almost at the end, Shimoda touched my shoulder. I leaned toward him, watching the movie, wishing he could have kept whatever he was going to say till after it was over.
